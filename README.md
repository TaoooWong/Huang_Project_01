Plan for Project Structure:
-Background: For any background information(currently empty).
-Code: For code used in the reports(currently empty, since R code is inside the reports).
-Reports: Store two reports
  1.'HW report.pdf': The first report.
  2.'HW 02 report - update to remove 999 outlier.pdf': The second report after fixing the value.
-DataProcessed: Store the processed date file 'lead-iq-01-clean'.
-DataRaw: Store the raw data file 'lead-iq-01'.
